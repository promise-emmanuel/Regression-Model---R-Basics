# Overview

In this project, I built a linear regression model using the R programming language to further my understanding of statistical computing and data visualization in a different language from Python. 

The software loads an in-built dataset, fits a simple linear regression model to predict miles per gallon (mpg) based on weight (wt) and cylinders (cyl), and then displays the regression equation along with a scatter plot featuring a regression line. Additionally, I included multiple functions to demonstrate various R datatypes (numeric, character, logical, factor and list) and used loops to process arrays. 

This project helped understand the basics of the R syntax, dataframes, and visualization with ggplot2. You can view a demo of the software in the video link below:
